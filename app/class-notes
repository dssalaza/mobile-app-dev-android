- Notes:
 - TextSize is set to sp measure to conserve user's preferences. i.e: textSize property.
 - imageView is set to dp measure because is independent of devices. i.e: layout_widht, layout_height.
 - Bottons are always set as a wrap_content on layout_width and layout_height.

 - Sometimes when a value/configuration is setup but don't show as done we should Build -> Clean Project
